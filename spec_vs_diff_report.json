  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements. REQ-15 is addressed in backend/main.mo (registerUser without admin role check) and frontend hooks. REQ-16 is addressed via AdminLoginPage.tsx, adminAuth.ts utilities, AdminDashboardPage.tsx with six tabs, and routing in App.tsx. REQ-17 is addressed via LoginPage.tsx device fingerprint handling, deviceFingerprint.ts, and the auth flow. The implementation appears comprehensive and aligns well with the build request constraints.",
